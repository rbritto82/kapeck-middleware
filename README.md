# kapeck-middleware
Middleware developed to mediate the communication between software and sensor/actuator network of the kapeck robot. The middleware encapsulates the original APIs of all sensors and actuators, facilitating the development of applications for the robot. The code was developed in C++.

A brief description of the middleware is provided in the research paper "A Distributed Hardware-software Architecture for Controlling an Autonomous Mobile Robot" and more details are provided in the master thesis "Uma Arquitetura Distribuída de Hardware e Software para Controle de um Robô Móvel Autônomo" (in Portuguese). A videos of the robot in action is available at https://youtu.be/EYjw3El1-CE
